# Comparative Analysis of Expert and LLM-Generated Presentations

## Overview

This repository is managed by Manas Narula and Sean McKeown as part of the assignment aimed at exploring the "expert" capabilities of LLMs compared to human experts across various topics. The project involved creating presentations on specific subjects (we chose "newspaper production" and "how to get to the PGA Tour." One presentation of each topic is completed solely by one of us, and the other is generated by an LLM. Our goal is to assess how closely LLMs can match or even enhance the quality of content produced by human experts.

## Assignment Details

Each topic within this project includes two distinct presentations:
1. **Expert Presentation:** Crafted by a human expert well-versed in the topic.
2. **LLM Presentation:** Generated by a non-expert utilizing an LLM.

## Repository Structure

Below are the links to the folders containing the presentations and evaluations for each topic covered in our project:

- [LLM Newspaper Presentation](./newsf.pdf)
- [Human Newspaper Presentation](./news.pdf)
- [LLM Golf Presentation](./golff.pdf)
- [Human Golf Presentation](./golf.pdf)

## Conclusion

This project not only tests the ability of LLMs to simulate expert-level content creation but also offers insights into the nuances that distinguish human expertise from machine-generated content.
