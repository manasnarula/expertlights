**GPT-4 was able to correctly determine that the "Golf Career Trajectory" presentation was created by a human and "How to Make the PGA Tour" was generated by an LLM. However, Claude seemed to get confused. According to the LLM, the "Golf Career Trajectory" presentation was very in-depth and "follows a more structured approach, with clear sections and subheadings," and Claude deciphers these descriptors as often seen in LLM-generated text. The "level of detail and comprehensiveness," the "more structured approach," the "conversational and expansive writing style, with rhetorical questions (e.g., "But how do you get to Korn Ferry?") and additional explanations," and the "incorporation of more visual elements, such as bolding, bullet points, and spacing" were the four main reasons that Claude leaned to this presentation being LLM-generated. The "more succinct and concise writing style, providing a high-level overview of the key steps without delving into excessive details" and "more visually clean and straightforward presentation, with simple bullet points and no excessive formatting or graphics" led to Claude's verdict that the "How to Make the PGA Tour" presentation was created by a human.**
